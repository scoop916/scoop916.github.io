	<h3>How I Spend My Time Inside</h3>
	
	<p>I enjoy spending time outside.  During times of inclement weather, I find myself spending a lot of time on my computer.  I've always enjoyed fixing and building things.  I've been fixing computers, cell phones, and other electronics for many years.  I decided, I should learn to not only fix/build hardware, but software as well to be completely well rounded.</p>

	<h3>How I Spend My Time Outside</h3>

	<p>When the weather is nice, I settle for any day without precipitation, I enjoy riding my skateboard. Living in a congested city with minimal parking, many times my skateboard is the most efficient way to travel around. I ride in the streets as well as in designated parks.</p>p
